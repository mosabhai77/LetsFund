# LetsFund
This is a SmartContract built on solidity meant for CrowdFunding. This can be easily used on any Ethereum based Blockhain..

This Smart Contract was created using Solidity.
The issue of the fund manager's incompetence is resolved here.
Let's say there is a company that raises money. When it asked you to donate money for charity, you did so, but the manager ran off with YOUR money still in his pocket.

We'll find a solution to this issue here:

A manager must establish a DEADLINE and TARGET before beginning a fund-raising campaign.
The manager can claim the funds raised from the SmartContract by receiving a majority vote of the contributors (regardless of the quantity of their contributions) if he is able to meet the DEADLINE and the TARGET. The contributors are entitled to a 100% refund if the management misses the deadline or the goal.
